          Skin Deep is a project about having a perfect body. As a transgender man, I frequently find myself at odds with my own anatomy. Sure, gender-affirming care and hormone replacement therapy have been incredibly helpful for me, but there have definitely been times where I’ve wanted to tear all my skin off and Frankenstein myself together in some sort of new form.

      So that’s where Skin Deep came into being! I found myself drawn to medical illustrations throughout time. Across various temporalities and cultures, the human body was viewed and interpreted in vastly different ways. What do all of these viewpoints have in common, since we all share having a body? In this website, viewers are encouraged to dissect and take apart a pre-existing body and re-assemble it to their own satisfaction.
